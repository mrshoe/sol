BUILDING SOL
----------------------
Mac OS X:
	% make

*nix:
	Edit Makefile to include Makedefs.linux instead of Makedefs.mac, then:
	% make

Windows:
	You're on your own, but it shouldn't be too difficult to compile with DMD
	and link in the necessary OpenGL and GLUT C libraries.

RUNNING SOL
----------------------
Usage:
	% sol scenefile

Example scene files are *.sol in the source directory.
